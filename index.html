    <p><b>Wouldn't it be neat if you could find excellent web hosting that is not only packed with features, but cheap as well? You need a reliable web hosting service so that you can join all the people who are earning a living through their websites. Learn which features you need and how much to spend so that you don't waste any of your hard-earned money on unnecessary web hosting costs. The tips below will let you determine how good a current or prospective web hosting provider is relative to its competitors.</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Make sure the host you choose has minimal to no downtime. It is frustrating if you try to log on to your site, and the server is down. If you have a business that relies on the internet for sales, this means you will lose a lot of money because your site is not operable.</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>A good web hosting service should bill you professionally. You should be able to log in with a username and password to have access to your account balance and make secured payments. If you have to send PayPal payments every months without getting account statements, you are not dealing with a serious web hosting service.</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>When searching for a reputable web host, you should aim to find one that has all the important documents. These include terms of Service, Acceptable Usage Policy, and Privacy Policy. These documents are meant not just to protect the host, but also the users. Ensure that when you find these documents that you look over them really carefully. If you can't find these documents on a host's website, then you should look elsewhere.</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>When choosing a web hosting company, you want to go with security over cheaper prices. It is important that not only is all of your information secure, but all of your customers' information, as well. Select a web hosting company that you know you can trust and that provides secure web hosting.</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Choose a web host that charges a low monthly fee. You can usually find a quality web host for between $5 and $10 per month. You may also be able to save money by paying for 12, 18 or 24 months of service at one time, instead of paying for web hosting services on a monthly basis.</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Never register your domain with your web hosting service. Many people mistakenly do this, and then realize later they can't transfer their site over to another web hosting service. This can happen when a company goes offline and bust or for other various reasons. Make sure you register your domain with a different company than your web hosting provider.</b></p><p><b>Establish how much you can afford to spend on web hosting. You can get discounts if you subscribe to web hosting for a while year instead of paying a monthly fee. Perhaps you should start with a monthly subscription to see if the host you have chosen is reliable and switch to a yearly plan later.</b></p><p><b>Make sure that the web host you select has a very high uptime guarantee. Uptime is the percentage of time that a server is online. For instance, if a web host claims that their servers provide 99% uptime, then their servers are online 99% of the time. You don't want to select a web host whose servers do not provide high uptime percentages. This is why uptime is so important when selecting a host.</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>You must know how to contact these companies to find out if they offer what you must have. It takes a bit of research and time to contrast services, but you will find a lot of honest providers out there. Use the preceding advice to streamline your search for a web hosting provider that will allow your business to flourish.</b></p>
